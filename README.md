# Email_spam_Detection

This project aims to classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham)
using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, text vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF, Count Vectorizer), and training models such as Na¨ıve Bayes, Logistic Regression, or deep learning models like LSTMs. The goal is to improve accuracy in filtering out spam
emails while minimizing false positives.
